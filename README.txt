Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, December 20th, 2012

This is a set of scripts to build the developer runtime for building and testing Steam games.

It builds chroot environments of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for both i386 and amd64 architectures and installs steam and a set of development tools and libraries within them.

You can build them from scratch by typing 'make' in the current directory.

Once you have created the chroot environments, see README.txt in their top level directories for instructions on how to use them.

You can customize the packages installed by editing files in content/packages/

Enjoy!
